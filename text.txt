achivments for us: 

YOLO -

To get the YOLO achievement on GitHub, you need to merge a pull request (PR) that was assigned to someone else for review, without waiting for them to actually review it. This is considered a "bad practice" (hence the YOLO badge name), as it skips the intended code review process.

How to get it:

Create a repository with at least two collaborators.
Have one collaborator open a pull request and assign it to another user for review (not yourself).
Merge the pull request yourself before the reviewer has a chance to review or approve it.
This action should trigger the YOLO achievement on your GitHub profile.


PAIR Extraordinaire - 

How to get the "Pair Extraordinaire" achievement:
Make a commit with a co-author using the Co-authored-by trailer in your commit message.
The commit message should look like this:
Code
Some commit message

Co-authored-by: user1@example.com
Co-authored-by: user2@example.com
At least two different GitHub users must be listed (including yourself).
Push the commit to a repository on GitHub.
Both you and your co-author will get the badge on your profiles.
