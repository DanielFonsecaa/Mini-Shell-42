fix: list envp size was returning one less 

 - list envp size was returning one less
    cousing the new node not appear on the list when calling export

 - fix export, now it add, update and print everything perfect with no leaks :)

 - add a debbug function that prints every info of the list

 - add a argument on the create envp node function to verify if is exported or not

 - fix my update_export that was creating 2 nodes when has arguments

 - fix env, was not printing last node

 - need to clear the files that has lot of garbage, sorry

 - need to add documentation, I can do it later
